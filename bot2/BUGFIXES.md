# Bug Fixes Applied

## Bug #1: Temporal Features - Boolean Conversion Error
**File**: `temporal_features.py` line 115  
**Error**: `AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'astype'`  

**Problem**: 
```python
df['earnings_soon'] = (days_until_earnings < 7).astype(int)  # WRONG
```
When `days_until_earnings` is a scalar (not a Series), the comparison returns a boolean, and booleans don't have `.astype()` method.

**Fix**:
```python
df['earnings_soon'] = int(days_until_earnings < 7)  # CORRECT
```

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Bug #2: Utils - Series Comparison Ambiguity
**File**: `utils.py` lines 144-161  
**Error**: `ValueError: The truth value of a Series is ambiguous`

**Problem**:
```python
def percentage_change(current, previous):
    if previous == 0:  # WRONG - can't compare Series to scalar with ==
        return 0
    return (current - previous) / previous
```

**Fix**:
```python
def percentage_change(current, previous):
    import numpy as np
    result = (current - previous) / previous
    # Handle both Series and scalars
    if hasattr(result, 'replace'):
        result = result.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], 0).fillna(0)
    return result
```

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Bug #3: Unicode Display - Windows Terminal
**File**: `test_system.py` throughout  
**Error**: `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character`

**Problem**: 
Windows terminal (cmd/PowerShell) doesn't support Unicode checkmarks (✓/✗).

**Fix**:
Replaced all Unicode symbols with ASCII equivalents:
- `✓` → `[OK]`
- `✗` → `[FAIL]`
- `🎉` → `***`
- `⚠️` → `***`

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Test Results After Fixes

All core functionality tests now pass:

```
[OK] Feature Computation (40+ features)
[OK] Data Preparation (train/val/test splits)
[OK] Model Building (143K parameters)

Results: 3/3 passed
```

**Note**: API connection tests require .env file with API keys (see SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.txt)

---

## System Status

✅ All bugs fixed  
✅ Core functionality working  
✅ Ready for use with API keys  

Next step: Add Polygon API key to .env file and run full system test.
