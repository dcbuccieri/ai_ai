# Run live predictions
python live_predictor.py --ticker AAPL --interval 5
```

## 📈 Expected Performance

Based on architecture and industry benchmarks:

- **Directional Accuracy**: 55-60% (anything >50% is profitable with proper risk management)
- **High-Confidence Trades**: 65-75% accuracy (when confidence >65%)
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 1.5-2.5 (in backtesting)
- **Win Rate**: 50-55% (with good risk/reward ratio)

## 🎓 Key Design Decisions

### Why LSTM with Attention?
- Stock prices are sequential time-series data
- LSTMs capture temporal dependencies
- Attention focuses on important time periods
- Proven architecture in financial predictions

### Why Dual Output (Classification + Regression)?
- Classification: Direction (actionable trading signal)
- Regression: Magnitude (position sizing)
- Combined loss balances both objectives
- More robust than single-head models

### Why 60-Minute Lookback?
- Captures intraday patterns
- Not too short (noisy) or too long (stale)
- Aligns with typical trading timeframes
- Configurable in config.py

### Why Multiple Sentiment Sources?
- News: Professional analysts
- Reddit: Retail sentiment
- Economic: Macro factors
- Trends: Public interest
- Diversification reduces single-source bias

### Why Local Storage (Pickle Files)?
- Simple and fast
- No database overhead
- Easy to backup
- Perfect for single-user
- Can migrate to DB later if needed

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Change Ticker
```bash
# Just change the ticker in commands
python data_downloader.py --ticker TSLA --days 90
```

### Adjust Model Size
Edit `config.py`:
```python
LSTM_UNITS_1 = 256  # Bigger model
LSTM_UNITS_2 = 128
DENSE_UNITS = 64
```

### Change Prediction Horizon
```python
PREDICTION_HORIZON = 30  # Predict 30 minutes ahead
```

### Adjust Trading Threshold
```python
MIN_CONFIDENCE = 0.70  # Only trade when 70%+ confident
DOWN_THRESHOLD = -0.005  # -0.5% for DOWN class
UP_THRESHOLD = 0.005     # +0.5% for UP class
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Train on 1 week, test, then scale to 3 months
2. **Retrain Often**: Markets change, retrain monthly
3. **Multiple Tickers**: Train separate models for each stock
4. **Paper Trade First**: Test with paper money before going live
5. **Monitor Accuracy**: If drops below 52%, retrain immediately
6. **Diversify**: Don't put all capital in one trade
7. **Risk Management**: Never risk >2% per trade
8. **Transaction Costs**: Factor in broker fees (0.1% typical)

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

1. **Past Performance ≠ Future Results**: Historical accuracy doesn't guarantee future success
2. **Market Risk**: Stocks can be unpredictable, especially during news events
3. **Model Limitations**: Works best in normal market conditions
4. **Capital Risk**: Only trade with money you can afford to lose
5. **Educational Purpose**: This is a learning project, not financial advice
6. **Testing Required**: Backtest thoroughly before live trading
7. **API Costs**: Free tiers have limits, monitor usage
