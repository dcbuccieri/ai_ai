# Unicode Fixes for Windows

## Issue

Windows terminal (cmd.exe and PowerShell with default encoding) doesn't support Unicode characters like ✓, ✗, ≥, etc. This causes `UnicodeEncodeError` when logging or printing.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `test_system.py` ✅
**Changed**: All ✓/✗ to [OK]/[FAIL]
**Changed**: 🎉 to ***
**Status**: Fixed

### 2. `train_model.py` ✅
**Changed**: 
- `✓ Training pipeline completed` → `[SUCCESS] Training pipeline completed`
- `✗ Training pipeline failed` → `[FAILED] Training pipeline failed`
**Status**: Fixed

### 3. `predictor.py` ✅
**Changed**:
- `✓ TRADE` → `[TRADE]`
- `✗ DO NOT TRADE` → `[DO NOT TRADE]`
- `≥` → `>=`
**Status**: Fixed

### 4. `temporal_features.py` ✅
**Changed**: `.astype(int)` bug (not Unicode but fixed during same session)
**Status**: Fixed

## Testing

All fixes have been applied. The system now uses only ASCII characters that work on all terminals:

```
Before: ✓ Success
After:  [OK] Success

Before: ✗ Failed  
After:  [FAIL] Failed

Before: ≥ 65%
After:  >= 65%
```

## Why This Happens

Windows console uses CP1252 encoding by default, which doesn't include Unicode symbols. While you can change encoding with `chcp 65001`, it's better to use ASCII for maximum compatibility.

## Prevention

When writing new code, use ASCII alternatives:
- ✓ → [OK] or [SUCCESS]
- ✗ → [FAIL] or [ERROR]
- ✅ → [DONE]
- ⚠️ → [WARNING]
- 🎉 → *** or [CELEBRATE]
- ≥ → >=
- ≤ → <=
- → → ->
- • → -

## Status

✅ All known Unicode issues fixed
✅ System tested and working
✅ Logging works without errors
✅ Console output is clean

No further Unicode errors should occur during normal operation.
